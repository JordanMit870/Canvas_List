# Canvas_List

Done during the Fall 2024 semester at UIC. This was made using C++ in Visual Code. For this project, I was given a base file and empty class, and my job was to fill out the functions for the classes, wrote code for file to make the canvas, and create tests to check if everything was working. I also used gtest and gmock to help make my test functions. The code I wrote is in canvaslist.cpp, shape.cpp, and canvaslist_tests.cpp.
